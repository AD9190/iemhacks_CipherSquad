      <h2>About Hoogly</h2>
      <p> This district with its Headquarters located at Chinsurah town is within the Burdwan Division of the State of West Bengal. 
        So far history goes, the name 'Hooghly' is derived probably from the 'HOGLA', a tall reed, 
        which grows in abundance on the riverbanks and in the marshy low lands below them.
        The Portuguese founded the town of Ugulim (Hooghly), in 1579, but the district has thousands of years of heritage 
        in the form of the great kingdom of Bhurshut. The city flourished as a trading port and some religious structures were built. 
        One such structure is a church dedicated to a charismatic statue of the Mother Mary brought by the Portuguese.
        Chinsurah and Hooghly played a role in the Bengal renaissance and the Indian independence movement. 'Vande Mataram', 
        India's national song, 
        was composed by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay at Joraghat in Chinsurah, he had been an alumnus of the Hooghly Collegiate School. 
        Nazrul Islam's revolutionary songs were penned while he was imprisoned by the British in Hooghly Jail.
