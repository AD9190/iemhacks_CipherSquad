            <h2>Art and Crafts</h2>
            <p>West Bengal's arts and crafts are evidence of the state's rich cultural legacy and inventiveness. There are numerous traditional and modern art forms that have been handed down through the centuries in the area.


                The complex terracotta art that can be seen in many areas, including Bishnupur in Bankura, is one of the most remarkable types of artwork. The elaborate terracotta temples feature finely carved representations of mythological tales and commonplace events. This work of art offers a window into the people's artistic talent in addition to being an architectural marvel.
               
                Additionally, West Bengal is highly known for its folk art. The Paschim Medinipur district's Patua scroll paintings depict stories with vivid images, fusing creative expression with narrative.
