      <h2>About Kalimpong</h2>
      <p>Kalimpong is a hill station in West Bengal situated in the Mahabharat Range of the Himalayas or Lesser Himalaya to the east of Darjeeling. 
        The district was formed on 14 February 2017, after the bifurcation of the Darjeeling district. 
        It was once the hub of the trans-Himalayan trade between India and Tibet-merchants used to ferry goods by mule caravans over the Jelepla Pass
         on the Sikkim Tibet border.
        The precise etymology of the name Kalimpong remains unclear. The most widely accepted origin of the name Kalimpong is 
        'Assembly (or Stockade) of the King's Ministers' in Tibetan, derived from kalon (King's ministers) and pong (stockade). 
        It may also be noted that the name originated from the translation 'ridges where we play' from Lepcha (Rong), as it was
         known to be the region's traditional tribal gathering for summer sporting events. People from the hills also call the 
         area Kalibong (the black spurs).
        According to K.P.Tamsang, author of the book 'The Untold and Unknown Reality about the Lepchas', 
        the term Kalimpong is deduced from the name 'Kalenpung', which in Lepcha means 'Hillock of Assemblage', 
        in time, the name was distorted to 'Kaleebung' and later to 'Kalimpong'. Another possible derivation points to Kaulim, 
        a fibrous plant found in profusion in the region.
        Kalimpong is known for its educational institutions many of which were established during the British colonial period.
