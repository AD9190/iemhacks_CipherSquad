      <h2>About coochbehar</h2>
      <p> The name Coach-Bihar means the land through which the 'Koch' Kings used to travel or roam about ('bihar'). 
        The District is in the North-eastern part of West Bengal, bounded by the district of Jalpaiguri in the north and north-west, 
        the state of Assam in the east and the International Border in the form of Indo-Bangladesh boundary in the south and south-west. 
        North-eastern part of West Bengal, bounded by the district of Jalpaiguri in the north and north-west, 
        state of Assam in the east and the International Border in the form of Indo-Bangladesh boundary in the south and south-west.
        In fact, being the place of the Raj (monarchy), the district captures the bygone glorious past in the moods of local people even today. 
        The peace-loving people of Cooch Behar even boast of this beautiful city where the Maharajas (kings) used to stay 
        and never tire of narrating the Raj stories. Moreover, the place is so quiet and calm, void of the hassle-n-bustle of busy cities. 
        And above that, the climate here like the rest of North-Bengal is just fine to let you feel the freshness and beauty of nature all around.
