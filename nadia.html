      <h2>About Nadia</h2>
      <p>    Nadia is known for its deep historical and cultural roots. It was the center of the Nabadwip Hindu cultural movement, 
        which played a crucial role in the development of Vaishnavism in Bengal. The district is famous for its association with 
        Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a revered saint and religious leader. Festivals like Rash Utsav and Dol Utsav celebrate the 
        life and teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and attract devotees and tourists from across the country.
